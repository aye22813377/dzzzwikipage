    <h1>William Shakespeare</h1>
   <hr>
    <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small><br>
    <br>
    William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet,<br>
     playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language<br>
      and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the<br>
       "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately<br>
        39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of<br>
         uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language<br>
          and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<br>
          <br>
    Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age<br>
     of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and<br>
      twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful<br>
       career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the<br>
        Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he<br>
         appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of<br>
          Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about<br>
           such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and<br>
            whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often<br>
             criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners<br>
              of the period.<br>
              <br>
    Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early<br>
     plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best<br>
      work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among<br>
       them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest<br>
        works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies<br>
         (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.<br>
         <br>
    Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and<br>
     accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of<br>
      Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text<br>
       known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic<br>
        works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem<br>
         by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote<br>
          as "not of an age, but for all time".<br>
          <br>
    Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually<br>
     adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His<br>
      plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various<br>
       cultural and political contexts around the world.<br>
